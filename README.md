# Omandroid

Native Omarchy on Google Pixel phones: Arch Linux ARM, Hyprland and Omarchy's own packages running directly on the phone with a mainline kernel, and Android apps in Waydroid. First device: Pixel 7 Pro (cheetah, gs201).

Plan: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/060038bc-beff-497e-9643-4f322318b2be

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/omandroid` | Native Omarchy tooling: `capture`, `kernel`, `kernel-shell` |
| `bin/lineage-ref` | Builds LineageOS for the phone. Used as a rooted reference Android (M0) and, later, for Waydroid images |
| `kernel/configs/` | Our kernel config fragment, merged on top of arm64 `defconfig` |
| `device/cheetah/` | Pixel 7 Pro bring-up notes and device trees |
| `omandroid.conf` | Shared settings (source dir, jobs, container image). Override in `omandroid.local.conf` |
| `docker/` | Ubuntu 24.04 build environment |

Large trees live outside the repo, under `~/android/`:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/android/omandroid` | LineageOS 24.0 source. Includes Google's GPL Pixel 7 kernel at `out-kernel/google/gs-6.1` |
| `~/android/mainline/linux` | Our kernel repo: branch `omandroid` on mainline v7.3-rc6 (remote `upstream` is Linus's tree), one commit per subsystem so patches can go upstream |
| `~/android/mainline/pmos-tensor` | postmarketOS Tensor kernel, for reference |
| `~/android/reference` | Captures from the phone. Contains serial numbers and partition backups: never commit |
| `~/android/factory` | Verified stock factory images, used to restore the phone |

## Ground rules

- We only ever flash the boot images and userdata. Never `bootloader`, `radio`, `devinfo`, `persist` or calibration partitions.
- Every file we write carries an SPDX header: GPL-2.0 for kernel code, MIT for the rest.
- No code from unlicensed sources. Google's GPL kernel, upstream Linux, postmarketOS and Mesa are fine.
